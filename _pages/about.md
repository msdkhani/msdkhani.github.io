I am Masoud Khani, a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. My academic journey began with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, which laid the foundation for my interdisciplinary research in healthcare and data science.

As a research assistant, I have collaborated closely with medical professionals and healthcare organizations to create innovative, data-driven solutions aimed at improving patient outcomes. My expertise lies in interpretable AI, where my research has been featured in several top-tier journals in biomedical and health informatics.

Beyond my research, I have mentored undergraduate and graduate students, helping them develop the technical and analytical skills needed to succeed in their projects. This experience has further fueled my passion for knowledge-sharing and professional development.

I am deeply committed to advancing healthcare through data science and machine learning. By driving innovation and fostering collaboration between technology and medicine, I strive to contribute meaningfully to the future of healthcare informatics.
