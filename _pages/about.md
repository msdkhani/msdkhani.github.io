About Me

Hello! I’m Masoud Khani, a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. My academic journey began with a Master’s degree in Computer Science, leading me to pursue impactful, interdisciplinary research at the intersection of technology and healthcare.

As a research assistant, I have worked on a wide range of projects aimed at improving patient care through AI-driven solutions. My primary focus has been on modeling Electronic Health Records (EHR) to predict clinical outcomes, uncover risk factors, and support personalized care. This involves designing advanced predictive models, leveraging both structured (tabular) and unstructured healthcare data, and enhancing model performance while ensuring interpretability.

I specialize in explainable AI (XAI) and interpretable machine learning to ensure that healthcare professionals can understand and trust the insights provided by AI systems. My research also explores human-in-the-loop systems, where medical experts collaborate with AI models in decision-making, thus integrating human expertise with machine learning to improve safety and reliability.

My technical expertise spans a wide range of domains, including:
<ul>
	<li>Predictive Modeling with EHR Data for clinical applications</li>
	<li>Explainable and Interpretable AI (XAI) for healthcare decision-making</li>
	<li>Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning systems to enhance trust and usability</li>
	<li>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI to support medical text analysis</li>
	<li>Medical Image Processing for diagnostic insights</li>
	<li>Neural Signal Analysis to study brain and nervous system data</li>
 	<li>Social Determinants of Health analytics to identify key external factors affecting patient outcomes</li>
	
</ul>

In addition to research, I take pride in mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, helping them navigate complex research projects and develop technical expertise in data science, AI, and healthcare informatics. Seeing them grow has been one of the most rewarding parts of my career.

I am deeply passionate about advancing healthcare through cutting-edge technology and collaboration. By continuously pushing the boundaries of AI innovation, I aim to contribute to a future where data-driven solutions empower healthcare professionals to deliver more effective, efficient, and equitable care.
